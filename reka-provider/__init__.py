"""Reka as a Hermes model provider: pick Reka in ``hermes model`` or pass ``--provider reka``.

Reka serves open-weight models behind an OpenAI-compatible API at https://api.reka.ai/v1. What
this plugin adds over pointing a custom endpoint there:

* The model list is a conservative allowlist of models whose catalog metadata declares function
  calling and at least the 64K tokens of context Hermes requires. Unknown models are left out
  until their capabilities are reviewed; a live model ID alone does not prove compatibility.
* Context window, tool support, reasoning support and image input are declared for each listed
  model, so Hermes does not have to guess them.
* Reasoning effort goes out as the top-level ``reasoning_effort`` field Reka reads. With no effort
  configured nothing is sent and Reka applies its own model-specific default;
  ``none`` asks for thinking off explicitly.
* Images inside tool results (screenshots, ``vision_analyze``) reach the model as Hermes' text
  summary, because tool-image compatibility has not been qualified across models. Images you
  attach to a message still go to the models that accept them.
